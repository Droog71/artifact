# Artifact

<pre>
A mining, crating and automation game with a theme loosely based on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis>simulation hypothesis</a>.
The primary focus of Artifact is automation. If you build a large enough factory, dangerous objects called rifts will begin to spawn in the world.
Machines called "reality anchors" can destroy rifts and protect your factory from the hazards they create.
